# Contact_Mangement_03

System – Python GUI Project

# Overview

Smart Contact Keeper is a user-friendly desktop application built with **Python's Tkinter** library. It allows users to manage their personal or professional contacts through a sleek graphical interface that runs in a **dedicated new window**. The application makes it easy to **add**, **view**, **edit**, and **delete** contact information such as **name, phone number**, and **email address**.

All contact data is automatically stored in a local text file (`contacts.txt`), so user information is preserved even after the application is closed.
